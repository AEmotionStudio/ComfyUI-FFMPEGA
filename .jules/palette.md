## 2024-05-22 - LiteGraph Constraints
**Learning:** This project uses LiteGraph for UI, which renders components on an HTML5 Canvas. This makes standard DOM-based accessibility (ARIA labels, screen readers) difficult or impossible for individual widgets.
**Action:** Focus on visual feedback (colors, flashes) and keyboard shortcuts where possible, rather than relying on screen reader attributes.
